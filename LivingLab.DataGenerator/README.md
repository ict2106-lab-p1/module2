# Data Generator
This console app is to generate mock Energy Usage Log data for the usage prediction ML model training.  

Because there is no actual sensor data that we can work with, we need to generate some data to train our model.
Four devices have been setup to generate data for the model.

## Usage
- Navigate to LivingLab.DataGenerator and run `dotnet run`
- A csv file named `energy-usage.csv` will be generated in the `Data` directory
